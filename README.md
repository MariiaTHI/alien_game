# alien_game
In this project, we developed a game where a player fights against aliens. The game starts with a random number of aliens placed at the top row of a playfield. In each game iteration, the player can shoot at a column. If an alien is hit, its armor gets reduced based on the alien type. If no armor is left, the alien is dead and disappears from the playfield. In each game iteration, all aliens move one row downwards. If an alien comes to the ground (not the last row, but beyond it), the aliens win! If all aliens are shot before reaching the ground, the humans win!

The game is implemented in Python and consists of several classes, including StrongAlien, WeakAlien, ComputerPlayer, HumanPlayer, and Alien. The main class is called Game and contains the main game loop and the game's logic. It also generates a player based on the mode (human or computer), initializes the sky and aliens, and checks if there are any aliens left in the sky.
